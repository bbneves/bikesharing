### Overview
  The purpose of the study is to understand the usage of Citi Bikes in NYC to expand to other cities. 
  By evaluating the peak hours, type of public and common use of the bikes. We'll be able to better adapt the conditions to a smaller city.


### Results
  Now, some of the panels with a deeper explanation for whoever missed the full presentation.
  
  ##### Overall Stat: Understanding the Public

  In the image above we notice the following:
   - Most of the customers are loyal subscriber and male.
   - The peak hours are during rush hours
  So, the next city to start the business should have the following (in order to increase chances of success):
   - A greater male population.
   - Safe environment for traffic and bikes as most of the bikes will be used during that time.
   
  ##### Trip Duration
  
  Here we noticed that most of rides last less than 1 hour. This implies that the size of the city might not be a concern. 
  There is also no meaningful difference between trip duration between genders.

  ##### Highest Usage by Location

  The commercial area of the next city should be the target to where to add the bike stations. There will be a necessity to study the main routes of home-work traffic in order to increase the bikes usability.
  
  ##### Weekdays popularity

  UNKNOWN Customer are usually new-customers or tourist. 
  Normally, people will use during as a work commute system. So, comparing the amount of UNKNOWN to the total, the tourists do not account for most of bike usage. Therefore, the next city does not need to be a tourist focused city.
  
  ##### Genders by Weekday
  
  ![Screen Shot 2022-07-27 at 4 04 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103459820/181354643-cbb96d09-68d9-4d88-8011-0388b7687d7a.png)

  In this last panel, we can confirm that UNKNOWNs are mostly a single-use customer. Also, the usage between Male and Female may be different in the total amount, but their reasonability to use the bike are the same (work commute).  
  
### Summary

  This business model is reproducible in other size cities. The main concern would be the city population mentality in utilizing bikes instead of cars. 
  The next data to study should be the target city yearly weather and population interest in using bikes.
